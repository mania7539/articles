## 'event'
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event

* The Event interface represents **any event which takes place in the DOM**; 
	- some are user-generated 
		(such as mouse or keyboard events), 
	- while others are generated by APIs 
		(such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, 
		a video has been paused, and so forth). 

* There are many types of events, some of which **use other interfaces** based on the **main Event interface**. 

* Event itself **contains the properties and methods** which are common to all events.



## 'event.target'
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target

* A reference to the object that dispatched the event.
* The event.target property can be used in order to implement event delegation.
