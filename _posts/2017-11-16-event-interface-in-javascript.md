* The **_'event'_** keyword is the **_Event interface_**
* The Event interface represents **_any event which takes place in the DOM_**
	1. Some are user-generated 
		(such as **mouse** or **keyboard** events) 
	2. The others are generated by APIs 
		(such as events that **indicate an animation has finished running**, 
		a **video has been paused**, and **so forth**). 

* There are many types of events, some of which **use other interfaces** based on the **main Event interface**. 

* Event itself **contains the properties and methods** which are common to all events.



## What is the 'event.target' property?
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target

* A reference to the object that dispatched the event.
* The event.target property can be used in order to implement event delegation.
