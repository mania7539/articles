_Hey pals, in this article, I will show you the exact tools to use to setup Eclipse for custom android libraries to work with. Make sure you get all of them below so later we can directly start to setup eclipse._

## Get the Latest Version of Eclipse
Currently it's Eclipse - Neon 2 which covers Android development plugins. Just use it to update eclipse with its *“Android SDK Manager”*.
Download Eclipse - Neon 2 on [Official Website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/neon/R2a/eclipse-inst-win64.exe) or via [My private Space](\\QTHDAVIDRZLIU\David.Rz.Liu_SharePoint).

## Get JDK 1.6 and NDK rc7
It is important to make sure that you are using JDK 1.6 or compatible Java version to avoid problem when building.
Download JDK 1.6 on [Official website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html#jdk-6u45-oth-JPR) or via [My private space](\\QTHDAVIDRZLIU\David.Rz.Liu_SharePoint).

Do not use the latest version of NDK, you will later find eclipse doesn’t accept it just on its setting interface.
Download NDK rc7 on [Official Website](http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r7c-windows.zip)
Or via [My Private Space](\\QTHDAVIDRZLIU\David.Rz.Liu_SharePoint).

## Get Eclipse Android SDK Manager
Use this tool to update your SDK and toolkits to the target version like */Extras* and the relevant Android SDK version and latest */Tools* version to a better building experience and successfully APK building. 
```
Open your Eclipse > Windows > Android SDK Manager, and choose Tools > Install Packages.
```
