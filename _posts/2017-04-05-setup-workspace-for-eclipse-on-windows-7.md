_For using Eclipse, the first step is creating your coding workspace which everytime you can open it and load your preferences to get on work. In this article you will learn how to setup network disk and import your project on that to your workspace so later you can build your android codes with Eclipse._

### Connect Your Computer with Network Disk

### Create Eclipse Workspace
When the first time you open your Eclipse, you will be asked to locate an local address which later you will always use to load preferences of projects. For now, just choose which directory you like to get it started, and I will recommend you to use second disk which your Windows 7 OS doesn't locate.

### Import You Projects
It is important to make sure that you are using JDK 1.6 or compatible Java version to avoid problem when building.
Download JDK 1.6 on [Official Website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html#jdk-6u45-oth-JPR) or via [My Private Space](file://qthdavidrzliu/David.Rz.Liu_SharePoint/).

Do not use the latest version of NDK, you will later find eclipse doesnâ€™t accept it just on its setting interface.
Download NDK rc7 on [Official Website](http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r7c-windows.zip)
Or via [My Private Space](file://qthdavidrzliu/David.Rz.Liu_SharePoint/).

### Get Eclipse Android SDK Manager
Use this tool to update your SDK and toolkits to the target version like */Extras* and the relevant Android SDK version and latest */Tools* version to a better building experience and successfully APK building. 
```
Open your Eclipse > Windows > Android SDK Manager, and choose Tools > Install Packages.
```
